# Phase 2 Checkpoint — Authentication, Users, Roles, Authorization

**Date:** 2026-10-01 · **Status:** VERIFIED (2026-10-04) — see "Final End-to-End Verification" below.

## Already present when the project was imported (Replit)

- Clerk packages, `clerkMiddleware`, production Clerk proxy.
- `users` table (clerk_user_id, email, role USER/ADMIN, status ACTIVE/DISABLED).
- `resolveLocalUser`, `requireAuthenticatedUser`, `requireAdmin`, `/api/auth/me`, `/api/admin/access`.
- Sign-in/sign-up page components and admin boundary UI.

## Completed in this checkpoint

- **Bug fixed:** `ClerkProvider` was imported but never mounted and `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`
  had no routes — Clerk hooks could not work. Provider and routes now wired.
- **Bug fixed:** `publishableKeyFromHost()` silently fabricated a key when none was set.
- Clear "Authentication is not configured" screen when the web key is missing (no bypass).
- API startup environment validation (names only, never values).
- 15 Vitest tests: authentication (401, missing email claim, provisioning as USER,
  disabled 403, no error leakage, safe user shape) and authorization (401, USER 403,
  ADMIN allowed, role claim in token ignored) plus env validation.
- `promote-admin` operator script for first-admin bootstrap.
- Versioned migrations with an idempotent baseline.
- Package manager declared (pnpm 10.28.0, Node >= 22), runtime reinstall workaround removed,
  missing `drizzle-orm` dependency declared in `scripts`.

## Verification

See PROJECT-STATUS.md → Verification results.

## Environment configuration (2026-10-02)

Clerk development instance. Publishable key configured for web and API; frontend
Clerk initialisation PASS; no secret in frontend bundle. `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` configured and validated (server-only).
`DATABASE_URL` still missing, so backend, sign-in, user mapping and admin checks are
not yet tested. `STRIPE_TEST_API_KEY` is unrelated and not used. Details:
PROJECT-STATUS.md.

## Remaining

- `DATABASE_URL`, session-token `email` claim, then real sign-in / admin check.
- Lovable preview regenerates `bun.lock` (platform behaviour, see HANDOVER).

## Verification run (2026-10-03)

`DATABASE_URL` configured (Neon, project secret). PASS: install, typecheck, API build,
15/15 tests, migrations + seed on Neon, API startup, public endpoints 200, protected
endpoints 401 without/invalid session. NOT TESTED: live Clerk sign-in, live email claim,
`clerk_user_id` mapping, live USER/ADMIN/disabled checks, logout — no real test account
has signed in yet (0 users). Phase 2 was NOT marked VERIFIED at that time (superseded 2026-10-04). Phase 3 not started.

## Live check (2026-10-03, after real Clerk sign-in)

- PASS: real Clerk test user signed in; one `users` row created lazily with a Clerk `user_…` id in `clerk_user_id`, role USER, status ACTIVE (first-time creation + mapping).
- PASS: `GET /api/auth/me` returned 200 with the local user (role USER) in the preview's own session; email claim present.
- PASS: `promote-admin` run for this account; DB role now ADMIN.
- NOT VERIFIED on 2026-10-03 (PASS on 2026-10-04): `GET /api/admin/access` as ADMIN, disabled-account 403 and logout — the agent cannot use the user's browser session. Account was not disabled.

## Disabled-account investigation (2026-10-04)

- Report: after a manual Neon SQL `status=DISABLED`, `/api/auth/me` still returned ACTIVE.
- Code audit: no path sets `users.status` except the insert default for new users; `resolveLocalUser` updates only email/displayName/timestamps; no triggers on `users`; no webhooks/jobs.
- DB target: the running API and the agent use the same `DATABASE_URL` (Neon pooled endpoint `ep-small-moon-…`, database `neondb`).
- Reproduction: agent set the test row to DISABLED; it stayed DISABLED (re-read after 8 s), then was restored to ACTIVE. Nothing reverts it.
- Probable cause: the manual UPDATE ran against a different Neon branch/endpoint than the one in `DATABASE_URL`. No code change made. Tests 15/15 PASS.
- Live disabled 403 and logout 401: NOT VERIFIED (need the user's browser session). Phase 2 NOT VERIFIED at that time (superseded 2026-10-04: VERIFIED).

## Final End-to-End Verification (2026-10-04)

**Phase 2 is VERIFIED. Phase 3 has not started.**

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Clerk authentication (real test account sign-in) | PASS |
| Local user provisioning (Clerk id → `users.clerk_user_id`, created as USER/ACTIVE) | PASS |
| PostgreSQL role/status enforcement (role/status read from DB, not token) | PASS |
| ADMIN authorization (`promote-admin`, then `/api/admin/access` → `{"allowed":true,"role":"ADMIN"}`) | PASS |
| DISABLED account rejection (ADMIN + DISABLED, live session → `/api/auth/me` 403 `ACCOUNT_DISABLED`); account restored to ACTIVE | PASS |
| Logout → `/api/auth/me` 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED` | PASS |
| Automated auth/authz tests | PASS — 15/15 |

The disabled-account check first appeared inconsistent because the manual SQL update was run
against a different Neon database/endpoint than the application `DATABASE_URL`. This was
investigated and confirmed; no application bug was found and no code changed. The test was
then repeated on the correct endpoint and passed. No load testing or production-readiness
assessment has been performed.
